# Given a file of warnings, reports only those that are in the diff for the
# current pull request.  Works for Azure Pipelines, CircleCI, and Travis CI.
# Exit status is non-zero if any warnings are output.

# Example use:
#
# (command-that-issues-warnings > /tmp/warnings.txt 2>&1) || true
# git -C /tmp/plume-scripts pull > /dev/null 2>&1 \
#   || git -C /tmp clone --depth 1 -q https://github.com/plume-lib/plume-scripts.git
# /tmp/plume-scripts/ci-lint-diff /tmp/warnings.txt
#
# If you get a warning that /tmp/diff is empty, that might be because your
# clone is shallow and does not contain all the commits.  You can fix that
# by pulling upstream.  Or it might be because your branch is identical to
# the base/upstream branch.
